    after a DNS timeout.
  * Fixed a crash that occurs when a server sends a malformed
    Cache-Control: header (CVE-2009-3305). Thanks to Stefan Fritsch.
  * Removed support for read-only caches.  Nobody ever used it.
  * Changed the default value of diskCacheWriteoutOnClose to 64kB.

  * Fixed a bug that could cause infinite revalidation loops with servers
    that perform sloppy packetisation (IIS, I'm looking at you).
  * Fail expectations on the local interface.  This might or might not be
    what CVE-2011-3596 is about, difficult to say since nobody is speaking
    to me.

31 January 2010: Polipo 1.0.4.1:

  Cherry-picked fixes from 1.0.5.  Thanks to Julien Cristau.

  * Changed the default for chunkMemory: it is now 24 MB or
    one-quarter of physical memory, whichever is smaller.
  * Support for logging to syslog (thanks to Nix).
  * Made atom reference counts 32-bit longs; this should fix
    problems that people were seeing when running Polipo with
    humongous in-memory caches.

    vulnerable) (reported by J. P. Larocque).
  * Implemented use of IPv6 temporary source addresses (Frank Behrens).
  * Disabled use of unaligned range requests by default.  This is
    controlled by the variable allowUnalignedRangeRequests (reported

    timeouts.
  * Made logging configurable at runtime (thanks to Frank Behrens).
  * Implemented the infrastructure for asynchronous handling of 
    forbidden URLs.
  * Implemented the ability to redirect instead of returning an
    error for forbidden URLs.
  * Implemented support for Squid-style redirectors.
  * Implemented User-configurable uncacheable URLs, analogous to

  * Made disableVia and cacheIsShared to be true by default.
  * Increased the default value of serverMaxSlots to 8.
  * Made the disk cache code quote all characters except for a
    small number of ``known safe'' ones.  This is an incompatible
    change to the on-disk format.
  * Changed HTTP parser to pass all Pragma headers to the next
    hop; this should make some media players work through Polipo.
  * Changed the connection scheduler to avoid pipelining when
    there are idle connections to a given server.
  * Made Polipo obey parentProxy when tunnelling (proxying https).
  * Changed the default value of allowedPorts to be slightly more
    permissive.
  * Implemented tweakables for selectively disabling parts of the

2 September 2006: Polipo 0.9.10:

  * Fixed a crash when a client closes a connection at just the
    wrong time.
  * Fixed a crash that could happen when a server returned incorrect
    headers and closed the connection at just the wrong time.
  * Fixed restarting of connections on a server-side read error;
    this should avoid the ``connection reset by peer'' problem.
  * Corrected work-around for DNS servers that export both AAAA and CNAME.

    an entity to disk.
  * IPv6 tweaks for OpenBSD (thanks to Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).

    full.
  * Fixed an incorrect use of va_start (guaranteed crash on AMD64).
  * Fixed a possible race condition with a heavily pipelining client.
  * Fixed a crash due to incorrect handling of write errors in POST.

23 September 2005: Polipo 0.9.9:

  * Fixed a bug that could cause objects to be incorrectly
    determined to be dynamic (thanks to Joachim B. Haga).
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the local web server to expose
    files that are not under the local root (thanks to Wessel

  * Fixed an off-by-one bug when parsing NL-terminated headers.
  * Made Polipo forget about failures when finishing on the client side.
  * Polipo now sends Host headers even when speaking to an upstream
    proxy.  Some proxies take RFC 2616 literally, and require that
    (thanks to Zoltan Ivanfi).
  * Fixed some bugs in staleness computation, and implemented
    server-side max-age directives (oops!) (thanks to Charley Chu).

24 January 2005: Polipo 0.9.8:

  * Backported the lax HTTP parser from the head branch.
  * Fixed a race condition that could cause a crash if a single
    object was being superseded twice at the same time.
  * Fixed an incorrect test that caused Polipo to pipeline to all
    HTTP/1.1 servers, even when they were determined as broken (thanks
    to Daniel Koukola).

    carries no object.
  * Fixed a bug in handling of client-side Expect: 100-continue
    (reported by Charley Chu).

    issued in the order opposite to a client-side pipeline (many
    thanks to Joachim Haga).
  * Abort when the config file couldn't be parsed (thanks to
    Joachim Haga).
  * Fixed error handling in POST and PUT requests, which could
    cause a crash on an I/O error.

    crashes if a peer closed a connection when we're writing.
  * Fix a race condition that could cause ``error message lost in transit''
    errors if a request was cancelled during connect.
  * Check for exitFlag in workToDo: faster reaction to signals.

28 March 2004: Polipo 0.9.2:
  * Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when writing out small
    objects (thanks to Frank Behrens).
  * Made buffer allocation in httpParseHeaders dynamic.
  * Fixed the declaration of pipelineAdditionalRequests.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause empty directories to be missed
    when expiring the disk cache.

  * Fixed a bug that would cause errors to be reported with the
    wrong content-type.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause ``object vanished'' errors when
    using HEAD for revalidation.

  * Cleaned up authentication.
  * Made authenticated replies cachable in one of the cases allowed
    by RFC 2616.
  * Fixed a bug that could, under some circumstances, cause a
    password-protected object to be cached and returned to a
    non-authorized client.
  * Implemented 100-continue, controlled by the variable expectContinue.
  * Implemented tristate, 4- and 5-state variables.  Split
    proxyOffline into proxyOffline and relaxTransparency.  This is
    an incompatible change to the config file format.
  * Cleaned up the handling of allowed port ranges.  New
    configuration variable allowedPorts (and new type intlist).
  * Implemented tunnelling through the CONNECT method (https proxying).
  * Will now read a request body on error (avoids a deadlock).
  * Reworked the PUT/POST code to read the reply eagerly rather
    than waiting for the write to finish (avoids writing the full
    body on error and avoids the same deadlock as above).
  * Made server addresses sticky: will now remember which of a
    servers addresses worked last time, and use that address first.

16 january 2004: Polipo 0.8.99.1:
  * Fixed an expiry bug that caused DNS queries to be repeated on
    each request.
  * Added the variable ``preciseExpiry'' that prevents trusting
    the mtime during expiry.

14 January 2004: Polipo 0.8.99.0:
  * Implemented IP address-based authentication.
  * Implemented HTTP ``basic'' authentication.
  * Implemented variable body offsets for the on-disk cache; this
    makes the on-disk cache format incompatible with previous versions.
  * Made the number of server slots configurable.
  * Partially rewrote the disk cache code.
  * Fixed a file descriptor leak in the early error handling code.
  * Fixed a bug in the base64 encoder; this makes the on-disk cache
    format incompatible with previous versions.

    (100-Continue is not implemented yet).
  * Made the number of server slots configurable at runtime.

9 January 2004: Polipo 0.8.4:

    to a different address when socket(2) fails (e.g. when
    accessing a double-stack host from an IPv4-only client).
  * Fix a problem with servers stuck in the ``probing'' state.
  * Work around a bug in Konqueror that strips question marks from
    URLs.
  * Fix incorrect error handling when dealing with connection
    failures.
  * Fix a compile problem in dns.c.
  * Remove dependency on SSL, include MD5 code instead.
  * Fix signedness of s_maxage.

23 November 2003: Polipo 0.8:

  * IPv6 support, on both the client and server side, including
    DNS support and RFC 2732.
  * Reworked the DNS code.
  * Made it possible to compile without any particular resolver
    and without the on-disk cache.
  * Fixed a problem with the chunking encoder.
  * Made the config file parser grok octal and hex values, allowed
    colons and tildes in unquoted strings.
  * Implemented tilde expansion in some config variables.
  * Made Polipo slightly less eager to honour range requests for
    dynamic instances.  Marked generated objects as dynamic. These
    changes should solve some of the problems with PMM.
  * Implemented the If-Range header (on both the client and server side).
  * Implemented support for range requests smaller than one chunk
    (and hence for pmmSize being smaller than CHUNK_SIZE).
  * Fixed a bug that caused a deadlock (until a server timeout)
    when doing a POST/PUT request with no free connection slots.
  * Fixed a problem when diskCacheRoot didn't end in `/'.
  * Fixed a refcounting problem that could cause Polipo to crash
    on a DNS timeout.
  * Fixed an alignment problem that could cause crashes on 
    architectures that don't like unaligned memory accesses
    (thanks to Rob Byrnes).
  * Fixed a bug with the disk cache that caused spurious ``disk
    entry changed behind our back'' warnings (and in principle
    could cause data corruption, although that's very unlikely).
  * Made opening connections slightly less aggressive -- Polipo
    would sometimes open two connections where only one was needed.
  * Modified client-side code to notice client shutdowns earlier
    and notify the server side straight away.

7 October 2003: Polipo 0.7

  * Made the Request function a method of objects.
  * Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause data corruption.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause sending of incorrect data to
    the client on a range request.

    use up buffers.
  * Reworked UTC time handling to use timegm(3) when available.

12 March 2003: Polipo 0.4

  * Implemented expiry of the on-disk cache.

    three pieces.
  * Changed serving of chunked data to be more eager about
    serving a chunk's end marker.

1 March 2003: Polipo 0.3

  * Implemented retrying of timed-out DNS requests.
  * Implemented configuration mechanisms for case-insensitive atoms,
    time values and atom lists; censoredHeaders can now be configured.
  * No longer censors User-Agent.  Blame Beppe and Alain.
  * Changed the handling of hop-by-hop HTTP headers to deal with multiple
    Connection headers.
  * Made client-side errors and successful revalidation no longer
    close the connection.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the allocation of an extraneous 2MB (!)
    at startup.  Polipo can run in 100KB once again.
  * Fixed a refcounting bug and some incorrect frees that could
    lead to crashes when recovering from a server-side error.
  * Fixed a bug with POST/PUT that could trigger a failed assertion.
  * Made sure that POST/PUT don't get scheduled in multiple pieces.

17 February 2003: Polipo 0.2

  * Fixed an incorrect assertion that could cause crashes when the
    server is fast.
  * Fixed (hopefully) logic for 304 replies.
  * Minor tweaks to scheduling that cause some speed increase when the
    client is pipelining and the server is fast.
